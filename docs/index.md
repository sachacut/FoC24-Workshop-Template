**How can we build sustainably with earth using digital design and fabrication?**

This workshop, organised as a 4-hour interactive Think-Tank session, will engage in new discourse on the future of earthen construction and aims to raise as well as record key perspectives on what earth architecture could look like in a digital age. Such include the ways of interpreting highly tactile analogue techniques into robotically controlled processes, the implications of material performance and durability and the capacity for upscaling and adapting earth techniques across different geographies. These broad and complex questions are discussed under the 3 main themes of the workshop: Material, Process and Implementation.

The workshop thus aims to identify and compile the key material and technological challenges that are to be addressed by practice and research going forward. The organising team is bringing together guests from industry and academia alike, spanning the fields of earthen construction, sustainable management, and digital fabrication to share perspectives and encourage new interdisciplinary insights. This will take place between both speakers and audience members via a series of short presentations and subsequently a semi-curated discussion. The salient points of the discursive workshop will be transcribed and published as an open-source manuscript.
